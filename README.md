really really useful scripts

here's a few scripts I have written over the years:

* **beautify** will remove those annoying comments in conf files and present you with the bare content
* **highlight** is a beauty in itself. It is an ouput-highlighter for sylog tails and alike
* **sasl-auth-failures** will add IPs and/or ASNs to an ever growing ipset, useful for blocking those script kiddies
